[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

# Solution goes here

**Exercise:** The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their PMF.  What goes wrong?

Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

# Solution goes here
import numpy
num = numpy.random.random(1000)
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(num)
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='number', ylabel='pmf')

# Solution goes here
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(num)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='number', ylabel='cdf')
